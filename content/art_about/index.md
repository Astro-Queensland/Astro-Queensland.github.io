Art has been a lifelong hobby of mine. I have always loved to draw and paint, and recently I have been experimenting with digital art. 
On my instagram I primarily post art based on TV and video games, with a focus on portraiture. 
Feel free to DM me if you would commission a portrait of your favourite character!

On this site you can also find my science illustration scribbles, which
are free for you to use with attribution. Enjoy!

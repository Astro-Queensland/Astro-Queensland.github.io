Queensland is home to several thriving astronomy departments with expertise ranging from how planets form to the fabric of the cosmos - at UQ, UniSQ, and QUT. 

On this site you can find links to each of the departments and relevant contacts, how to join our mailing list, and updates on events we are hosting.
